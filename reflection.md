- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

The class is a pet shelter. It basically allows the user to add pets into the shelter and interact with them through the different methods.
We added a few more methods to get the pet's name, age, specie, and breed.
I initially had a different idea for this assignment, but I was nervous that it would be too much to do on my own, so I decided to join a group. It went well, but I feel a little disappointed in myself for not taking the risk.
